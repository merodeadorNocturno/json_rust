# json_rust
A small example to parse json with rust. Also, compared rust code to a javascript code that creates almost the same output using the same data source.

As it turns out, Rust is about 65% faster than node, but takes about 70 lines of (unexperienced) code to accomplish the same thing that node does using only 10 lines of code.
